## üêõ **Key Fixes Applied**

### **1. Publisher Lookup Fix**
**Problem:** Notifications weren't being created for new orders because the system was looking for a non-existent `users_permissions_user` relation on the marketplace model.

**Solution:** 
```javascript
// OLD (broken)
const website = await strapi.db.query('api::marketplace.marketplace').findOne({
  where: { id: orderData.website },
  populate: ['users_permissions_user'] // This relation doesn't exist
});

// NEW (fixed)
const website = await strapi.db.query('api::marketplace.marketplace').findOne({
  where: { id: orderData.website }
});

if (website && website.publisher_email) {
  const publisherUser = await strapi.db.query('plugin::users-permissions.user').findOne({
    where: { email: website.publisher_email }
  });
  // Create notification for publisherUser.id
}
```

### **2. Database Schema Fix**
**Problem:** Strapi was failing to start due to invalid relationship definition.

**Solution:** Removed `inversedBy` property from notification schema:
```json
"recipient": {
  "type": "relation",
  "relation": "manyToOne",
  "target": "plugin::users-permissions.user"
}
```

### **3. Message Content Fix**
**Problem:** Notification messages were trying to use `website.name` which doesn't exist.

**Solution:** Updated to use `website.url` and added fallbacks for user names:
```javascript
message = `You have received a new order from ${order.advertiser?.username || order.advertiser?.name || 'an advertiser'} for ${order.website?.url || 'your website'}.`
```

## üß™ **Testing Endpoints**

### **Test Basic Notification**
```bash
POST /api/notifications/test
{
  "title": "Test Notification",
  "message": "Testing the notification system",
  "type": "system",
  "action": "system_update"
}
```

### **Test Order Notification**
```bash
POST /api/notifications/test-order
{
  "orderId": 123,
  "action": "new_order"
}
```

### **Get My Notifications**
```bash
GET /api/notifications/my
GET /api/notifications/my?type=order
GET /api/notifications/my?isRead=false
```

### **Get Unread Count**
```bash
GET /api/notifications/unread-count
```

## üîç **Debugging Steps**

1. **Check Server Logs:** Look for notification creation logs:
   ```
   Creating new order notification for publisher 123 (publisher@example.com)
   Notification created: 456 for user 123 - new_order
   ```

2. **Test Direct Notification Creation:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/api/notifications/test \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title":"Test","message":"Testing"}'
   ```

3. **Check Database:** Verify notifications are being created:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM notifications WHERE recipient = USER_ID ORDER BY createdAt DESC;
   ```

4. **Test Order Flow:**
   - Create an order as advertiser
   - Check if publisher receives notification
   - Accept order as publisher
   - Check if advertiser receives notification

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Test the complete flow:**
   - Create order ‚Üí Check new_order notification
   - Accept order ‚Üí Check order_accepted notification
   - Deliver order ‚Üí Check order_delivered notification
   - Complete order ‚Üí Check order_completed + payment_received notifications

2. **Test withdrawal flow:**
   - Request withdrawal
   - Admin approve ‚Üí Check withdrawal_approved notification
   - Admin deny ‚Üí Check withdrawal_denied notification

3. **Frontend testing:**
   - Check notification bell shows unread count
   - Check notifications page displays correctly
   - Test mark as read functionality
   - Test notification deletion

## üìù **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue: No notifications appearing**
- Check server logs for errors
- Verify user authentication
- Test with `/api/notifications/test` endpoint
- Check database for notification records

### **Issue: Publisher not receiving new order notifications**
- Verify marketplace has correct `publisher_email`
- Check if user exists with that email
- Look for "Publisher user not found" logs

### **Issue: Notification bell not updating**
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify JWT token is valid
- Test `/api/notifications/unread-count` endpoint directly
